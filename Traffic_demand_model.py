#Reveal time
    #1. Part of the flights (60%) is known at 00:00:00
    #1. Function of departure time (10-15 minutes before departure)

#Drone Type
    #1. 3 types (20, 25 and 30 knots)
    #2. Equal proportion
#Priority (perhaps based on distance) (higher is more important)
    #1. 3 Levels and a 4th for emergency flights 
    #   food local deliveries more important
    #   loitering more important
    #2. Equal proportion
#loitering:
    #1. Needs to be destined in constrained airpsace
    #2. Needs to be destined not in range of Dcenter
    #3. Choose random
